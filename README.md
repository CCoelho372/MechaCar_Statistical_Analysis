## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

###### Summary

Vehicle length ( p = 2.60e-12) and ground clearance (p = 5.21e-08) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope is not considered to be zero. The slope (r-squared) was .6825. The linear model can predict mpg effectively because p value is less than .05 and the multiple r-squared is .6825 which makes the prediction ~68% effective.
