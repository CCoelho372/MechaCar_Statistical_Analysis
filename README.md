## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

###### Summary

Vehicle length ( p = 2.60e-12) and ground clearance (p = 5.21e-08) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope is not considered to be zero. The slope (r-squared) was .6825. The linear model can predict mpg effectively because p value is less than .05 and the multiple r-squared is .6825 which makes the prediction ~68% effective.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

###### Summary

The current manufacturing data meets the design specifications for all manufacturing lots in total but not each lot individually. The toal PSI variance is 62.3 which is under 100. There are some lots such as Lot 3 which has a PSI variance of 170.
